# Cloud OCR SDK 

ABBYY Cloud OCR SDK provides Web API that can be easily used in C#, Java, Python, or any other development tool supporting communication over network. 

This repo contains a set of samples in different programming languages showing how to create a simple client application using API V1 for processing image with the specified parameters and exporting the result.
